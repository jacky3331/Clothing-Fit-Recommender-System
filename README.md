#### Clothing-Fit-Recommender-System ####
A machine learning algorithm which predicts how a piece of clothing would fit a user with specific set of characteristics (i.e. height, weight, size, etc.); utilizing data from renttherunway to make predictions.

#### Project Updates ####
- Implemented Softmax Regression for classification of whether a piece of clothing would be (small, fit, large) for a user.
- Experimentation w/ different hyperparameters (test size, regularization, class balance, etc.)
