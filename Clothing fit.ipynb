I had originally rented an 8 and 10 and when I saw that the straps were quite long (make sure you wear them criss-crossed), I contacted the RTR customer service who suggested sizing down. I did that and ended up wearing the 6. It fit great. I wore a backless sticky bra and was good all day! The top is fitted, so that helped to keep everything still while I was on the dance floor, too. The dress was casual enough for a daytime, outdoor ceremony, but also dressy enough for the party. The material is heavy and elegant - I received compliments all day long! I have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt. I would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently showing more side boob than you might want! Lastly, I wore the Tova Blue Mohawk earrings which seem like they were made for this dress. Compliments on those as well. I can always count on RTR to make me look like a million bucks!',\n",

I originally grabbed this dress in the Georgetown RTR store as a back-up because it just looked pretty \"eh\" while on the hanger, but when I tried it on, I instantly felt like a princess.

I\\'m 5\\' 6\" - 5\\' 7\", and the dress was about an inch or two too long, and there is way too much fabric and layering to hem it with the tape they sell at RTR, but that was easy to fix with one inch Jack Roger wedges (easier to dance in as well :)). Overall, the dress was amazing, the colors photographed perfectly, and  I felt great at my senior prom. ',\n",

I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. \\n\\nRE: FIT/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you\\'re a 4/6 girl and you\\'ve been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you\\'ll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!  I was worried I wouldn\\'t be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.  I was \"worried\" that the sleeves wouldn\\'t fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!\\n\\nRE: LENGTH/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today\\'s trends, most gals would say it\\'s way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it\\'s illusion top and glittery \"burnt\" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn\\'t mind one bit. If that\\'s a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. \\n\\nRE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring. My shoes were plain nude peep-toe pumps.\\n',\n",

If you just need to sit and look pretty then it'll probably be fine. Other wise the dress was really pretty and I received a lot of compliments.

I wore a size 2, but looking back on the pictures taken of me that night, it looked like I gained 20 lbs.  I probably should have gone down another size, because I felt subconscious about my cleavage all night and the flare of the dress made my bottom half look a little too big for my liking.

I was a little apprehensive about the lace on this dress since usually it can be unforgiving and uncomfortable, but the lining on this little number made it great! I\\'m a short girl, about 4\\'10\" and the slit came up pretty high, but that wasn\\'t an issue for me as I covered my lap with a napkin once seated at dinner. The cut is low, but not too low. I have a larger bust, 36D, and with a little strap adjustment, my girls sat in there nicely. The only downfall to the low neckline is a little spillage for those larger busts when you\\'re sitting down- still not enough to be an issue. I would rent this again and again!',\n",

In order to play “Preacher’s Wife” I feel like I had to step up my game.\\n\\nAfter dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding I attended as an adult, I’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few Dillard's jams over and over, desperately trying to style them into something fresh. Enter RTR and this lil beauty.\\n\\nPROS: GORGEOUS detail. Lace for days. Great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business. Beautiful open back and delicate chest detail. Love the two pintucks on the front. Also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling. Tons of compliments! Looks pretty with pearls as well. AWESOME to dance in. Both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling out.\\n  \\nCONS: I’m gifted in the booty department, so I was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum. The waist was defining but not as dramatic as I would have liked. I also have a smaller chest and found that I needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top. The lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain, so watch out! \\n\\nHMM: There’s a bustier / inlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived, but I was able to make it work without it!\\n\\nI’m still giving this thing a 5/5 because I loved my RTR experience and I see this dress in my dreams. We already miss each other. Come back to me, Shoshanna dress. \",\n",

I hung the one I wore from both ends in my bathroom by a hot shower running (for awhile) and that seemed to solve the problem. The strap up top could've been a little tighter but it wasn't noticeable and the smaller size was too small. I did love the back and thought it was worth the small issues I dealt with. I also felt very comfortable in the material. I was glad I rented the bigger jewelry I did because it helped with the front of the dress.

The color was unmistakable, and I was the only one wearing red at the wedding, which made this an unforgettable dress! It was very comfortable to dance in. This dress fit snugly in the bust, waist, and hips. As I get a tad bloated after eating/drinking, this dress did show this by the end of the night. So I would not recommend to someone trying to hide the belly. I did not wear a bra nor spanx with the dress, as the material is very sensitive in the rear, and would have shown the spanx outline, so I decided to take them off. There is built in wiring/lining in the waist and bust. \\nCustomer service was extremely helpful. My first choice dress was damaged, so I could choose another dress, and when that one did not fit, they overnighted me this dress. \",\n",

The sequins are not overly gaudy - they seem the shimmer in the light! And the slit on the side is sexy but not too high. As others have mentioned, it is a big snug in the midsection, and runs a bit short. I ordered the 0L and 2L, and ended up wearing the 0L. I'm only about 5'5, but with my 4 inch heels, the regular would have been too short. The long worked perfectly! The midsection was a little tight, which is why I wanted the size 2 as a backup. The bust, however, is a big large for someone with a small chest, like me. I would have worn the 2L had the bust not been big on me. My advise is order a size up as backup, but if you are small in the bust, you may end up sticking with your usual size. It really is a lovely dress, and I highly recommend renting it!\",\n",

I chose to not wear a bra with this gown because of the open back, but you could definitely use a seamless adhesive bra or silicone coverups for extra comfort and concealment.

This dress was pretty adorable, but I personally didn't love the pattern; it looks amazing in the stock photo and the mid-section hits her just right, but it wasn't as pronounced when I wore it and I missed that! Overall, still a great dress and it was my fiance's favorite of the three dresses I rented this time around. :) \",\n",

I wore it on-air for a public affairs show and have been approached so many times since - not because of the interview, but because of this jumpsuit! The tailoring and the color made me feel truly regal. Plus you can wear it as a professional look or for going out. My only gripe (which is why there are four stars and not five) is that it's low cut. Like, crazy low cut. So low cut that I don't know how anyone wears it without pinning it or double sided tape. My tape actually started to give right before the interview, so I had to pull the back up with a hair tie at last minute. It totally worked and I felt very Fashion MacGyver, but would have been much easier if they simply put a clasp on the front.\",\n",

The top part was snug in the rib cage area, so I opted to go up a size. It was nice that you could wear a strapless bra underneath (although I didn't even bother since the dress was snug, secure, and thick enough to go without).

Here's the catch-if you are busty at all, this is probably not the dress for you.  I am ordinarily a size 4 and asked for the 6 as a backup.  It's a good thing I did because I barely got the zipper up on the 4 in the chest.  It fit beautifully everywhere else but absolutely squashed my chest.  I had to wear the 6 and even that was a bit snug in the chest.  Unfortunately it was big everywhere else.  The 6 made my bottom half look much bigger than it did in the 4.  All in all it worked out but it would have been an over the top home run if the top were more proportionate to the bottom.  I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before so I do not feel like it's me.  If you are a B or less this is probably a perfect choice.   \",\n",

I feel like the style of the dress would fit any number of occasions, though. The color in person is very pretty and I received a lot of compliments on this rental!\\n\\nMy only issue was with the hardware of the dress. The dress stayed up, for the most part. There is a silicon strip at the top of the dress to help it stay in place, but the strip on the dress I received was partially worn away so I was tugging it up more often that I think is normal for that dress. Also, the zipper eye-clasp faced inward, so I had a few scratches on my side from the clasp rubbing against my skin. ',\n",

They are really an in between color, and will go with either gold or silver accessories. I wore it with gold accessories and nude/beige shoes. If you are going to have trouble with the fit of this dress it will probably be the top. I found the top to be a little too big around the shoulders, even when I wore the smaller of my two selected sizes. The dress is tighter around the bust but larger in the shoulders. Probably difficult to fit perfectly for a lot of body types. Both the 8 and the 10 fit but the 10 was really too big on top and you could see the edge of my bra through the arm hole. The 8 was still a little gappy and I was going to try to fix it with fashion tape.

I'm assuming it was fairly new, as the lace was stiff and thick, so I couldn't lift my arms above me head (not that there was much of this happening anyway, but the under breast lace would also make this a bad idea). \\n\\nWish I would have gotten a photo of the full lace back, it was amazing and I received compliments all evening. Went no bra and felt that the stiffness of the lace top provided enough support. Although the dress is lined, I did wear spanx underneath to tighten up and smooth out everything.

The only downside to my  experience was that the size 0 came without the liner, had a rip in the mesh in a very noticeable place, and was strangely too large on me compared to the 2. (The 0 was larger in the arm openings and length, as well as the waist hitting lower... Maybe it was mismarked?) Thankfully the 2 fit like a 2 should and was in great condition. It was very comfortable to wear and I got more compliments than I could count, which is saying a lot at a wedding of 25 people. I agree with the stylist notes: keep shoes and accessories simple with this fabulous dress. I wish I owned it and would probably rent again.

The dress runs true to size, and if you're like me, you can enjoy the exposed back without a bra cutting across the geometric structure.  This dress is a lot darker than it appears in photos.  It's more of a dark silver/gray.  Still, it was absolutely stunning and surprisingly comfortable. \",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"Overall, I loved this dress and I thought it flattered me very well.  But there were a couple of small things that made the dress a strange fit.  \\n1. The bust area is extremely loose.  It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.  I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).\\n2. Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.  If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.  Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.  However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.\\n3. The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.  I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).\\n\\nThe dress is stunning and flattering to curvy figures.  It just needs some adjustments to make it the perfect fit.\",\n",

My husband asked me several times what it would cost to keep it and I got tons of compliments from friends and strangers alike.

I got the 12 L and it was long enough for me to wear 3 inch heels for an effect similar to the model photo - the back of the train swept the floor and my shoes peeked out just a bit in the front.

       "  'review_text': 'The fit of this gown was spot on. I am usually a size 12-10. Depending on the brand. I ordered a 10L with a 12L as back up. The size 10 fit like a glove. As you can see, the 10L was actually a little short. The 12L was EVEN SHORTER, ;like 4 inches shorter (bizarre). I\\'m not all that tall. About 5\\'7\" in bare feet. My heels brought me up to about 5\\'11\" and the 10L still didn\\'t graze the ground (the 12L was UNWEARABLY short! Seriously, I almost wish I\\'d gotten the XL). \\n\\nI was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves. I have a very true hourglass figure, with just a bit of a tummy. This draping on this dress concealed EVERYTHING! I\\'m not kidding! It also helped with my \"less than perfect\" arms. \\n\\nThis dress has a good amount of stretch. The only thing I wasn\\'t crazy about was the amount of layers. The pictures don\\'t really showcase that the bottom has three layers: one stops right at your bum (so be careful if you are bottom heavy -- it will cut into you), the second helps show less leg behind the slit, and the top lies as you would expect. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this dress. It was very comfortable and it didn\\'t feel too heavy. I am big busted (36DD-36DDD) and I was able to wear a Spanx singlet and a normal bra. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely re-rent this dress for a different occasion. I would especially recommend this dress for any event that is taking place in a ballroom or a hotel (which are notoriously COLD). I was comfortable throughout the event, while many of my friends complained of being cold. ',\n",

I had to get the size 0 because the 2 wasn't available, and while it fit everywhere else, it only hit me mid-thigh and I am slightly shorter than 5' tall. Definitely not church-appropriate and I am not even sure I would have worn it to something like a wedding, because it was tight enough that it crept up when I walked and I think by the end of a night with drinks, it would have been a bit much. I'd rent it again for something like a wedding or a Derby event, but I'd order a size up. The other thing I wasn't crazy about was that the exposed zipper is large and will not lay flat, so your backside looks lumpy from the side.

The SR was a little too loose on top and didn\\'t wear it because I didn\\'t want anything to fall out. ;)  The length was just above my ankle so I was able to wear a cute, heal with an ankle wrap.  The V in the front was just deep enough to be noticeable but not too revealing. The back draped beautifully, not too revealing at all. I liked that there were pockets but I was only able to carry a tube of lip gloss because they were shallow.  It was a nice material and the gold accent at the neck line was nice too.  ',\n",

I have hips and a butt, so I chose to size up and wear the 6 instead of the 4, just so I could drink and eat that night, but the 4 fit very similarly (just a smidge snugger on the hips). The pockets are always a plus and the material was super soft (felt like a brushed cotton). It also had a stretch to it, which also added to the comfort level. The sleeves weren\\'t too tight, also, and I have slightly more muscular arms for my size. Overall, a great dress you can wear to a work event, a wedding or a party! ',\n",

It was a little big on me, but that's because I've been losing weight and overestimated the size, but it still hung very nicely and look radiant. The color is lovely. It's stretchy fabric, sturdy construction. I wasn't hot even though the wedding was outside. I could dance in it. I wore spanx and they didn't show because the hem is nice and low. I paired with nude wedge heels and they looked great. No jewelry needed. The dress is the statement. Lots of compliments from strangers. Made me feel fancy at a very fancy wedding. \",\n",

The open back was awesome (loved the draping) and a really cool way to show some skin, but that was the only thing that was really working for me. The straps were very thick and tight on my shoulders, and the bust was extremely small - not a problem I've ever had to face before haha! I would hesitate to try this again in a size up for fear of it slipping out of place - was quite low cut, so I wore petals instead of a bra. I unfortunately had to continually adjust while wearing, but I'm sure this would look fabulous on another lady! I definitely recommend sizing up.

This is not my typical style and I don't usually wear bright colors - but I got SOOOO many compliments.  The dress was a little on the loose side, and up until the day of the wedding I was going to wear my backup (which was a little too formal for a beach wedding) but then my friends talked me out of it and told me this dress looked really great.   PROS: pockets, love the damn pockets - perfect dress for a beach wedding\\nCONS:  I tend to be a little flatter on top, so if I had brought a padded bra with me or if I naturally had a larger chest then I think this dress would have felt like it fit perfectly.  \\nOne thing I would like to point out, I was under the impression when I rented the dress that this was a backless dress - but it's not (at all).  Completely fine to wear a bra with this dress - no special bra needed.

I'm usually a 4 and wore a 4 in a this dress, as I did not have a backup size due to a computer glitch. (Tip: I ordered using my iPhone. I don't think ordering from a mobile devise works as great as doing it from a  computer as I ordered a size 6 for my backup, but when the order completed, it was not in the cart.) The 4 fit like a glove. It would have been perfect except I couldn't take a few steps without the skirt hiking/riding up. I felt self conscious tugging it down continuously. So if you plan to do a lot of walking, dancing, etc., I would advise you to go one size up. I think I would have been more comfortable with a 6. Overall, though, this is a very eye-catching dress.

Definitely not good for work or conservative environments, but a camisole would fix that. For social outings, this is a very nice dress. I\\'ve had a lot of different designer dresses now with unlimited, so I guess I\\'m a bit jaded, but this isn\\'t a \"show stopper\". The pattern is different enough to stand out in a crowd though.

Secondly, it\\'s cozy without being terribly hot. Because of the winter-like pattern of the dress fabric, I picked it for a winter holiday party, which usually means being chilly through the event because your coat over in the coat check. Not this time! Bare shoulders and arms but still comfy- but never too hot or sweaty. The fabric has a good weight to it without being too heavy. The dress just feels substantial. It almost feels like you are just carrying a nice throw/blanket around with you all night. The bottom of the skirt poofed nicely and the bodice fit perfectly. I had my 3rd baby 8 mo ago and am never sure of my size right now, but surprisingly fit into the 10L (170ish lbs and 5\\'10\") but I do not have a big bust or rib cage. Rented a punk rock style statement necklace to tone down the Queen Elsa vibe the dress may give off. Worked out fantastically. I felt wonderful and received many compliments from strangers (which is very nice of them). ',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"This was my first dress rental from RTR and I was very pleased. The dress itself is understated, so not a good choice if you want to stand out from the crowd. I received several compliments--but the best one was from the bride herself because she is a fashionista! She said she had rented her dress for the rehearsal dinner from RTR, too! A couple of notes to share...The dress runs small (in my opinion) because it is so fitted in the bodice and hip area. I usually wear a size 6, but wore the size 8 and it was perfect. You need to buy a backless/strapless bra for this dress because the ivory lace back and inset on the front are see through. It's a sweet sexy detail, and you don't want bra straps showing! The color is a lovely muted blush rose color, and it blended perfectly with my daughters' dress (in photo). I wore this dress with Jessica Simpson nude platform pumps. Overall, it was a nice choice for this wedding event. \",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I was a little disappointed when I received this dress. I ordered it to attend an opera auction, and when it came I almost went and purchased a dress. I had ordered an 8L and a 10L. I am only 5’7 but I usually wear at least a three inch heel with no platform. I ended up wearing the 10L even though I typically wear an 8, because the 10 hung better. I was unimpressed with the fabric, which I felt detracted from the quality of the dress. It was a slinky mesh material, so you could see every bump underneath it. I didn’t wear any undergarments because of that. I didn’t feel the dress was overly flattering on my body type. I have a wide rib cage, broad shoulders, big chest, and small waist. Despite how uncomfortable I felt in the dress or how I felt it looked on me, I received more compliments on that dress than I have ever before on any purchase.  I had men coming up to me saying the dress was stunning. The auctioneer referred to me as the “stunning lady in red” after I won a bid. Women approached me to tell me how gorgeous I looked. One woman said I looked like Anjelica Huston and another said Jessica Rabbit. Bottom line is the dress was a show stopper and very glamourous. It is also very comfortable to wear. ',\n",

I'm on the shorter, ~curvier~ side, and was looking for something colorful, cute, and conservative-ish for a pretty traditional church wedding. I love that this dress has a high neckline so I didn't have to worry about unwanted cleavage - sometimes you want the cleav, and sometimes you're in a church with a bunch of people you don't know and their grandmothers. The dress is comfortable, and the color is pretty and bright without being obnoxious. As another user mentioned, you will want a racerback bra (or no bra if you can), as the front of the dress cuts in a bit and the sides of my bra sometimes peeked through. The dress has those handy straps inside to hold your bra straps in, but there is a slight risk of side-bra exposure. Not terrible, but something to be aware of. Overall, I loved this dress and would rent again.\",\n",

The 4L was about four inches longer than the 2L which you can see still hit the floor even though I was wearing four inch heels (not pumps).  The 4L also came without a zipper pull on top so I contacted customer service and decided to wear the 2L. The material has stretch so it hugs even the straightest of figures, I do not really have hips and my butt is fairly small, but it looked cute (I don't have a picture) I loved that I could wear a normal bra and thong with this dress. The material is high quality so it is not see through and is heavy enough that I don't recommend wearing it in the summer sun, however it is the perfect weight for inside events! I was able to dance all night, sit comfortably, and breathe in this dress without it stretching out. I paired it with sparkly drop earrings, a center French braid and slicked back pony tail up-do, and a sparkly bracelet to keep it simple.

       "  'review_text': 'The fit of the dress was pretty true to size. I like dresses that have a tighter fit up top, but usually with that it means that it is hard to move around. With this dress, however, even with it being tight, it was still easy to move around! The only issue I had with this dress was that the zipper was a little messed up so it took a little bit of time to get on, but other than that it was great. The only thing I would mention is it was just long enough for my feet to be covered in flats, so if you like heels, your feet might show a bit.',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"Ok, this dress is stunning. The fabric could not be prettier (it's a neoprene material, by the way). The pros are exactly how beautiful it is, that it is really warm for winter, and it has an overall very flattering fit. It is rather short by the way, so dark thighs may be a necessity. It has some cons though. The first one is that it has a weird fit in the arms. The opening between shoulder and arm is rather large, but then the fabric compresses the arm itself. So, it accommodates a thicker arm around the shoulder, but not at the biceps area. This was annoying, and I felt pretty uncomfortable wearing it because of that. Two other cons, which are no big deal: the sleeves are really long. It's ok for wearing it standing up, but if you need your hands at all you will have to bring the sleeves up, which is not very easy to do with this dress, and also loses part of  its charm. The second is that the dress is warm indeed, so you will feel hot if you are either walking a lot, dancing or just being at a warm enough venue. One thing which may interest some: I was 6 months pregnant when I wore it, and it does not compress the belly at all. I was quite comfortable there in spite of the bump, my discomfort was all because of the arms. \",\n",

The fabric is pretty heavy and does not allow for much stretch, and for that reason I would say this style works best for A to C bust sizes.  With the one shoulder look on this gown, I would suggest going with a strapless bra.  The natural waist is definitely very fitted, but it did allow comfortable room throughout the midsection.  I would suggest sizing up for fuller hips as that area is definitely quite fitted.  The one shoulder sleeve was definitely a bit tight on my broader shoulders, so that\\'s definitely something to keep in mind.  At 5\\'7\"  this hit right at the bottom of the floor without heels so I would definitely suggest a long length for women my height or taller.  This dress is perfect for a black tie wedding or gala, and I would pair it with a beautiful pair of long earrings, a shiny clutch and strappy heels.',\n",

I am 5\\'2\" 115 lbs with a 30F bust.. After reading other reviews I  decided to size up. I typically wear a 0-2 and orderd a 2 & 4. I wore the 2  since it fit my waist better but I ended up with the oh so lovely armpit boob overflow all night. My other issue was the boning. The boning ends just at your natural waist and was pretty uncomfortable so after a long night of dancing I ended up with a scab on my hip where the boning rubbed. The length was perfect with 4 in heels. Of course being so short it didn\\'t have the same dramatic high-low look like the model but I still loved it.

Some dresses make you work to wear them, but this dress isn\\'t! It\\'s like wearing that comfy sweater - where you don\\'t have to worry about bra straps sticking out, sheer material for an oops moment, too long trails, etc - but you still get to look fabulous. \\n\\nFor sizing, I think I could have even gone down one size as my waist is more petite, and that area is the most fitted area of the dress.

Actually, if you are curvy Monique Lhuillier is the way to go. I am between a 4 and 6 in the hip area.  and a 2-4 at the top. I can successfully wear a size 4 in this designer dresses and add a padded bra to accommodate the bust area. This dress very fitted  from the bust through the thigh area, with extra volume created with layers of crinoline. If you like drama and creating your moment this is your dress.',\n",

(I thought the 6 would be big but the dress runs small and was very form fitting. I wore Spanxx.)   I wound up returning my other dress and wearing this one. Perfect for a formal wedding because the sequin are subtle and the cut out in the back is tasteful (I'm usually super conservative so this was fun and adventurous to wear. I felt great!) I was able to wear a strapless bra with it (the first strapless bra I tried peeked out the back so try on multiple ones before you give up.) I wore bronze peep toe shoes & very minimal jewelry. The sequin did not irritate my arms like some users said. The slip does show on the bottom a little but I didn't mind.

They weren't too different except that the 6R had a bit more fabric bunching up right at the waistline. Unless you are a true 2 I would highly recommend getting the 4R, and the 6R as back up, depending on the size of your bust. Sometimes I can wear a 2 depending on the dress, but I don't think the 2 would have fit me. This dress is fun, photographs well (especially while dancing and twirling), and made me feel so pretty. ***Look out for the long tulle back when getting out of vehicles or standing up from a seated position. Your heels can easily catch the back of the dress and tear the tulle. \",\n",

The pleats and thicker fabric allow the dress to billow out too, which is lovely. I also loved the pockets. One thing to point out is that the dress is quite heavy so if you plan on dancing, be prepared to hold up your dress as people will step on your train. I give this dress a 4 out of 5, is because the dress had a bit too much room in the chest area for size 0. I am an A cup, and there was room in the dress for a C cup at least. I did read previous reviews that the dress was great for larger breasts, but I assumed the size of the cup would be adjusted for size 0.  Stick on cups were my best friends that night. ',\n",

I was confused and a bit nervous after reading all of the reviews, because I wasn't sure what to expect and didn't have a backup plan. I did have to go a size up from my  usual size, and I wouldn't have minded a bit more length and would probably go with the long rather than regular length if I could do it again. But it didn't matter that much because of the wrap-around style and short skirt in front. I wore edgy, lace-up shoes with my hair loose and bouncy to balance it all out. It definitely has a gunmetal shimmer and works well with dark silvery accessories. And at an event with 10,000 people, I never saw anyone else with the same dress on so I was happy about that. My only complaint is that it doesn't have any stretch, so it's a bit confining. But overall, I loved it and would absolutely recommend it for any black tie affair!\",\n",

I used double-sided tape to tape down the chest area of the dress as well as the straps 3) The store only had an R length, which was just right when I wore my really tall heels (around 3.5-4 inches), but when I walked up stairs, I often would still step on the skirt mistakenly or almost trip.

I\\'ve rented from RTR every year for my boyfriend\\'s formal black tie event at work that he has annually, and I\\'ve never been disappointed.  This dress kind of felt like it was out of my comfort zone when I first saw it because of the gold detailing as well as the mermail tail look at the bottom, but I took a leap of faith and I\\'m SO glad I did.  I typically wear a size 6, and it ran true to size (ended up getting a 6L because I saw some mention of it running short but the 6R was good for my 5\\'4\" frame).  The dress arrived in pristine condition, and I paired it with simple black open-toed heels and I was ready to go!  It\\'s a super flattering dress that doesn\\'t feel constricting, but if you do a little bit of dancing it is a little more snug in the hips (nothing a little hiking up of the dress won\\'t fix).  Overall, was SO pleased.  My boyfriend loved the dress, and I got compliments all night.  Made me feel like a PRINCESS! :)',\n",

I would definitely recommend renting this! \",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"This is a beautifully designed and well constructed dress!! On the hanger it doesn't look like anything special, but when you put it on it comes alive- especially if you have curves!! The lace was thick, well constructed, and sewn onto the solid lining so it doesn't shift. AMAZING. The darker color and lace overlay hide body flaws pretty well, but I did pair it with Spanx to smooth everything out. I wore it with an adhesive bra as well to not have to deal with a traditional strapless (straps would be visible through the lace). If you are petite and/or pear shaped like me this is a great choice since the shift style does not have a defined waistline and there was plenty of room in the hips. I'm still in the process of losing the remaining baby weight and this dress was very forgiving while still looking sharp.\",\n",

Either way, I ended up with a ton of compliments, and miracle upon miracle, I was actually able to dance in it!\\n\\nOther than that, the dress was perfect! The fabric on both the top and skirt were thick, so I could easily go without a bra, and I even wore red underwear and you couldn't see a thing. Pockets are definitely a bonus too, they are HUGE, and I could easily carry my phone around without seeing a single lump in the skirt.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend if you are OK with flaunting what you got!

I received many compliments on the dress and felt sexy in it...not to mention my husband matched my dress color perfect also, so we complimented each other. The color of the dress in the picture is a little brighter than the actual color. I would call it magenta instead of pink. The 4R was perfect in length as well, with a 3-4 inch heel that I wore. Thought I would mention that I am also a mother of two kids and still have a little pooch, but this dress gave me a tight midsection look because the fabric is stretchy and added some tummy control.

I wore it to a black tie NYE wedding, and even though it was short, I felt like the fabric, fit, and the way it sparkled made it fit in just fine with the other formal gowns.  I usually wear a 6 or an 8 in dresses.  I ordered a 4 and a 6, and true to other reviewers' comments, the 4 fit me very well.  The chest area was just a tad loose, but that typically happens when I try on dresses...nothing a more padded bra couldn't fix!  The cut and fit were very figure flattering.  By the end of the evening I experience a little chafing under my arms from the sequins, but that was after 5 hours and it was very minor.  Thank you RTR for a great first experience, I'll definitely be back!\",\n",
